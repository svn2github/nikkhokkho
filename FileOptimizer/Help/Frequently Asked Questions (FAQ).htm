<b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b>
<br ><i>Why are several downloads available?</i>
<br >Available downloads come separated in a binaries (executables) form, suitable for x86 and x64 architectures, and in a source code archive. Both are usually available in several package formats.
<br >
<br ><i>What is the sense of FileOptimizer, if standalone tools are already available?</i>
<br >Indeed you can manually execute the commandline tools that FileOptimizer uses as plugins, but this will be probably less comfortable. Specially if you consider you will need to execute one or another depending on the file format, and to chain some of them to obtain best results.
<br >
<br ><i>What is different in FileOptimizer compared to similar tools?</i>
<br >General idea on tools like PNGGauntlet, ImageOptim, RIOT, etc is essentially the same.
<br >FileOptimizer is built-in with lots of plugins that allow it to handle a big variety of file formats. Optimized files are usually smaller than in competing products, or comparable at worst. It is easy to use, and at the same time easy to automate. Is a native Win32 application, being compact and fast, and works portable with no external dependencies nor access to the system registry. Finally it is free and open source.
<br >At the moment, it is not much mature, lacks some features, and is not configurable at all.
<br >
<br ><i>Are optimized files identical to the original ones?</i>
<br >Optimized files, will look identical to the original ones, but internally they will be different in order to achieve the size reduction.
<br >For images, bit depth reduction is used when possible. For instance an image encoded with 24 bit color depth could be resampled to 8 bit color depth if 256 colors of less are used. Quality should not be affected after the transformation.
<br >
<br ><i>Why are original file stamps not preserved after optimization?</i>
<br >FileOptimizer supports restoring original file attributes once it has been recompressed. This includes creation, and modification timestamps, but also read-only, system, archive and hidden attributes. To enable it, mark the checkbox "Keep file attributes" under "Options -&gt; General".
<br >
<br ><i>Have the optimized files same degree of compatibility as the original ones?</i>
<br >Generally yes, they have the same degree of compatibility. The exception is JPEG images, when you have enabled the <i>User arithmetic encoding</i> option. It generates smallest files with the same quality, but require recent software to render them.
<br >
<br ><i>Will optimized files load faster?</i>
<br >Definitively yes, optimized files are smaller, less information needs to be transferred from the internet, of from the local disk, and will load faster in a direct proportion with the size reduction.
<br >Decompression speed of the optimized files is also proportional to the size reduction, because used compression algorithms are asymmetric (slow compression and fast decompression).
<br >
<br ><i>Does optimized files work on other platforms than Windows?</i>
<br >Yes, since they are the same format as the original ones, they will continue to work, no matter if they are rendered in a web browser, an Android or iOS application, or any other desktop program.
<br >
<br ><i>Why is the recompression process so slow?</i>
<br >The speed of the recompression depends on the particular format of the file.
<br >Noticeably PNG processing is the slowest, because the brute-force recompression to squeeze them. As opposite, PDF and JPEG files should be encoded pretty fast.
<br >
<br ><i>Does it work on other platforms than Windows?</i>
<br >FileOptimizer is reported to work in some environments under UNIX based operating systems with Wine.
<br >For other platforms, you will need to install a virtual machine such as VirtualBox with Windows XP or later.
<br >
<br ><i>Why a particular format is not supported?</i>
<br >Even if I do my best to add new format support to FileOptimizer, I may have missed some.
<br >If the format to add has available a Windows command-line tool to optimize it, it can be easily integrated on FileOptimizer, so please, let me know.
<br >
<br ><i>How can I disable a particular plugin?</i>
<br >You can use the INI setting 
DisablePluginMask= to allow excluding execution of certain plugins. For instance 
DisablePluginMask=leanify;advpng.exe will prevent executing any plugin 
containing in its name leanify or advpng.exe. <BR>As you can see it is case 
insensitive, and allows more than one item to be specified by using semicolon 
(;) as separator.<BR>
<br ><i>Can I prevent certain file formats from being processed?</i>
<br >If they are supported by FileOptimizer, unless you could remove all the plugins used to treat this format, it will not be possible.
<br >The workaround would be to not add those type of files.
<br >
<br ><i>I can appreciate some quality loss on PDF optimization. Why?</i>
<br >PDF are recompressed with no loss of quality, but images can be downsampled, and so on, allow certain lost of quality, specially at high zoom levels. You can control it under Options -&gt; PDF -&gt; Profile.
<br >
<br ><i>How is the command line syntax?</i>
<br >FileOptimizer command line arguments work like:
<br >C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe "C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia"\<br>
Where:<br>
- C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe: Is the full path where FileOptimizer executable is.<br>
- "C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia"\: Is the full path of the folder to recursively process. Be aware enclosing it with double quotes as in the example, which is Windows mandatory if the folder contains spaces, or extended characters.<br>
Alternatively you can specify only one single file instead of a folder:<br>
C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe "C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia\av-214_.zip"<br>
Where:<br>
- C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\Win32\Release\FileOptimizer64.exe: Is the full path where FileOptimizer executable is.<br>
- 
"C:\PROYECTOS\FileOptimizer\_Tests\_ - copia\av-214_.zip": Is the full path of 
the file to process.<BR><BR><EM>Is there a way to silent install 
FileOptimizer?</EM><BR>You can specify the /S command-line switch to the 
installer, and it will install FO with no prompts: <BR>FileOptimizerSetup.exe 
/S<BR>Since it is implemented over NSIS, you can take a look at <A 
href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter3.html#installerusageexamples">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter3.html#installerusageexamples</A>
          for further reference.
<br >
<br ><i>Why my HTML, CSS or JS files are not optimized being them supported?</i>
<br >As of version 6.50, optimization of CSS, HTML, Javascript and its derivatives is supported. They follow the same lossless concept as other formats, so once compressed they will render and look exactly the same as the original, but with a reduced file size.
<br >Unfortunately those optimizations may cause your files to not be editable anymore by WYSIWYG tools such as Dreamweaver, and to avoid risks they are disabled by default.
<br >To enable them, simply go to <i>Options-&gt;CSS-&gt;Enable Tidy</i>; <i>Options-&gt;HTML-&gt;Enable Tidy</i> and <i>Options-&gt;JS-&gt;Enable JSMin</i>.<BR><BR><EM>Why 
FileOptimizer is not using all my CPU cores?</EM><BR>Making FileOptimizer a 
multithreaded application involves a major rewrite of it. Basically, GUI can 
only run in the main thread, which implies a big reengineering. Some progress 
has been done since 2 years ago, but it is getting more and more difficult as 
its codebase enlarges. Also having plugins such as ECT or mp3packed which are 
already multithreaded, makes less sense to continue the task.
<br >
<br ><i>Why there is a donate button being the program free?</i>
<br >FileOptimizer is free either for personal and commercial usage. I have spent hundreds of hours in creating, developing, researching, supporting, testing and maintaining it, so if you consider a donation is worth my effort, it is highly appreciated, but not mandatory. Program will work as the full version without any limitations, no matter if you have donated or not.
<br >
<br ><i>How much should I donate?</i>
<br >There is no minimum nor maximum in 
the donations. Simply consider the benefit it is reporting to you, and how the 
compensation you will give to the future of FileOptimizer should be. Donations 
of even 1 euro, are welcome the same as 1000 euro.<BR><BR>

<EM>What if I have 
problems donating?</EM><BR>             Current <a href="http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/images/FileOptimizerDonate.html" target="_blank">donation</a> platform is managed by <A href="https://www.paypal.me/FileOptimizer" target=_blank>Paypal.Me</a>, which is fast and safe. Unfortunately it is not supported in all countries and currencies, so you can try the old Paypal platform <A href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=XE3E37GGZV6EY" target=_blank >here</a>.
<br >
<br ><i>Where is latest source code?</i>
<br >Source code for releases is available in the <i>Download section</i> above.
br >Latest development code is available in the <A href="https://sourceforge.net/p/nikkhokkho/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/FileOptimizer/" target=_blank >SVN repository</A>.
<br >
<br ><i>Where can I send suggestions, comments and bug reports?</i>
<br >Better place for easily followup comments, suggestions and bug reports is on the <A href="https://sourceforge.net/p/nikkhokkho/discussion/" target=_blank >Discussion page at Sourceforge</A>.
<br >
<br ><i>How can I contribute the project?</i>
<br >If you want to contribute and actively participate in the evolution of FileOptimizer, your help is highly appreciated.
<br >You can donate money, or send patches and improvements in the source code, or even send suggestions, or bug reports.
<br >
<br ><i>Why is FileOptimizer available in warez portals?</i>
<br >Recently I have found some Torrent sites, as well as warez portals offering repackaged FileOptimizer distributions.
<br >Be warned that those sites usually include malware in their packages, mostly adware to give them incomes with no effort nor credit to the original authors, so if you opt to get elsewhere, you are not only underestimating my work, but also putting your PC in risk.
<br >Obviously, the author, me, has no relationship with those sites, and what is more important, I am not seeing any advantage on pirating a software which is already free.
<br >Remember that 
FileOptimizer is free, and open source, being always available as direct 
download from its official page: <A 
href="http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer">http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer</A><BR><BR><EM>Can 
you give more details on how FileOptimizer works? <BR></EM>As said before, 
FileOptimizer is only a frontend for external command-line applications, called 
plugins. Those plugins are the ones which does the hard part, and the ones 
deserving creting. This is why usually optimization bugs happen in plugins, 
instead of in FileOptimizer side. If you need more details about the internals, 
please take a look at the links above with the official sites for them, where you could get lots of technicaldetails.&nbsp;
